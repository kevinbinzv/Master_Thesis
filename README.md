Abstract
This thesis explores machine learning-based baseline estimation methods for residential households, particularly focusing on their application in demand response strategies. By compiling and analyzing baseline estimation methods, this work proposes optimal demand response strategies for a sample of 300 households in Australia taken from electricity provider Ausgrid. These households, equipped with behind-the-meter photovoltaic systems, present a unique opportunity to study the impacts of photovoltaic intermittency on smart meter readings and overall energy management.
An Incentive Based Demand Response (IBDR) mechanism is formulated to show the load reduction during peak hours, profits retained by the retailer, and benefits gained by the customer for shifting the load during peak electricity consumption periods. Various baseline estimation methods are thoroughly studied to quantify the incentives for residential customers, including averaging methods and machine learning models, evaluated for customers with different consumption levels. Different demand response event days are selected and evaluated to ensure a broad range of results.
Key findings include the significant load reduction potential of the IBDR mechanism, particularly among high-consumption customers. The Random Forest Regression model consistently provides the best fit for demand response event day load curves, highlighting the superiority of machine learning models over simple averaging methods in baseline estimation. The analysis emphasizes the need for adaptive approaches, as per the No Free Lunch theory, suggesting future exploration of hybrid or ensemble models. Effective consumer education on peak-hour consumption is crucial for enhancing grid stability and promoting sustainable energy practices. These insights underscore the importance of targeting high-consumption customers with demand response incentives and the variability in model performance, paving the way for more efficient demand response programs.
In the end, the code used for this thesis is provided for the evaluation of baseline models to quantify the fair amount of compensation that should be provided to the residential customers for participating in the demand response program.
